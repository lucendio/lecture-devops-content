Frequently ask questions
========================


#### 1. Where do I even start?

The first step would be to get an overview of what [this repository](./README.md#table-of-contents) and the
[external resources](./README.md#external-resources) contain. As a second step, you might want to grab a coffee
and click your way through the [lists of link collections on the topic of *DevOps*](./links.md#devops). Most of
them not only provide a comprehensive list of technologies but refer to books, blogs and other 
knowledgeable resources, as well. Then, as a next step, you could try to get
[the application](https://github.com/lucendio/lecture-devops-app), that is going to be deployed as part of the exercise
implementation, to run on your local machine.

You might also find [this roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) useful to you. It shows you a possible learning path. 
Towards the end, you may postpone the monitoring part until the end and instead have a look into cloud-related things
first.


#### 2. I have no clue about DevOps. How am I supposed to write this concept?

Don't worry. It's an initial step to get you start digging into things related to DevOps. After handing in the
concept you will receive individual feedback, that you can use to iterate over your design and implementation. So,
nothing is set in store. You can change things along the way - after some consultation first.


#### 3. Where do I get some infrastructure to play with or maybe even for the exercise?

Have a look at the link section on [*Infrastructure resources*](./links.md#infrastructure-resources).
