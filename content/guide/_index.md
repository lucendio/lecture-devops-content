Guidance & Tips
===============

*NOTE: the content of this document is not finite but also not updated regularly*

This guide should give some advice on how to approach the [*project*](./../assignments/project.md)
assignment and how to deal with certain barriers you might face along the way.
Depending on which approach you choose, the content may be applicable only to a certain extend. It
is based mostly on personal experience and thus somewhat opinionated. You are more than welcome to
walk your own path.
