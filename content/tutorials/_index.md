Tutorials ðŸ’¡
============

These tutorials are intended to be small and __voluntary__ hands-on exercises that might be
worked on during class. Ideally, every lecture topic (weekly) comes with one or more
corresponding exercises.

Performing these tasks should help you to get familiar with technologies you
might be going to use in your [project assignment]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}}).

{{< hint >}}
There is also a tutorial on [how to install the tool chain]({{< relref "./install-tool-chain">}}).
{{< /hint >}}

The tutorials vary a bit in their workload but still cover a limited scope. Solutions may only
utilize the basics of the technologies that are involved, while their capabilities would reach
far beyond that.

For more comprehensive tutorials either refer to the
[link collection]({{< ref "/links" >}}), their corresponding [lesson]({{< ref "/lessons" >}}) or 
the web search engine of your least distrust.

Each tutorial contains:

* a description, including prerequisites, tasks and objectives(s)
* at least one possible solution, including the steps to reproduce, and, it needed, any kind of *assets*
