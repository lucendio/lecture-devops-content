you discover all the provided materials and explains how this course is organized.


## Prerequisites

* not afraid of the Terminal or command-line interfaces

{{< hint info >}}
*__NOTE:__ experience from previous semester showed that working on a Windows machine
might become tedious and might even result in [data loss](https://github.com/lucendio/lecture-devops-app/commit/b1a4614b35f9c892e5bf08fc0792283ba360d493).
For possible solutions, please refer to the [FAQ]({{< ref "/faq/#unix-on-windows-workstation" >}})*

pieces
