Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

{{< hint danger >}}
## ++++ BREAKING ++++

All upcoming deadlines have been put on hold as long as services and infrastructure are unavailable.
The timeframe will be extended for 2 weeks starting on the day when all required services are operational
again. New binding [dates]({{< ref "/dates/ws2324" >}}) will be communicated promptly after that. Review
time slots may need to be adjusted accordingly.

{{< hint info >}}
Experience from previous semesters show that working on a Windows machine
might become tedious and could even result in [data loss](https://github.com/lucendio/lecture-devops-app/commit/b1a4614b35f9c892e5bf08fc0792283ba360d493). For possible
solutions, please refer to the [FAQ]({{< ref "/faq#linux-on-windows-workstation" >}})
