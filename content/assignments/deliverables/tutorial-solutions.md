Deliverable: Tutorial Solutions
===============================


__SUBMISSION DEADLINE:__ at the end of the last week within the lecture period, or - in order to
                         collect a fraction of the grade in advance - at the end of day of lecture
                         *one* week after the tutorial was part of the lecture topic


## Requirements

### Formal

* language: German or English
* put all tutorial solutions together in one dedicated repository 
* use a folder per tutorial solution named after the tutorial
* hand in the link to the repository (see navigation *Dates*)
* the repository may not be public in case some log files contain sensitive data


### Content

* each solution folder contains:
  * all *deliverables* (see respective section in tutorial description)
  * documentation if necessary for reviewing 


### Remarks

* ‼️ example solutions are just meant as an inspiration not to be copy/pasted and handed in ‼️
* details about deliverables can be found in every tutorial description
* `terminal.log` refers to the entire terminal in- & output produced while carrying out
  the tutorial, which means: no manipulations; instead copy as-is (of course, cleansed of
  any encoding artifacts, e.g. ANSI color codes, or other gibberish making the logs not readable)
