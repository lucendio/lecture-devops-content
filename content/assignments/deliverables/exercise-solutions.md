Deliverable: Exercise Solutions
===============================


__SUBMISSION DEADLINE:__ at the end of the [last week within the lecture period]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}}),
                         or - in order to collect a fraction of the grade in advance - at end of the day on which the
                         subsequent lecture is given (usually 8 days later) in relation to the lecture that exercise was
                         part of (see *Activities* column of the [course plan]({{< ref "/lessons" >}}))
                         


## Requirements

### Formal

* language: German or English
* put all exercise solutions together in one dedicated repository 
* use a folder per exercise solution named after the exercise
* hand in the link to the repository [before deadline expires]({{< link-to-dates-of-current-semester >}})
* the repository may not be public in case some log files contain sensitive data


### Content

* each solution folder contains:
  * all *deliverables* (see respective section in the exercise description)
  * documentation if necessary for reviewing 
  * any other file necessary to complete the exercise


### Remarks

* ‼️ example solutions are just meant as an inspiration not to be copy/pasted and handed in ‼️
* details about deliverables can be found in every exercise description
* `terminal.log` refers to the entire terminal in- & output produced while carrying out
  the exercises, which means: no manipulations; instead copy as-is (of course, cleansed of
  any encoding artifacts, e.g. ANSI color codes, or other gibberish making the logs not readable)
