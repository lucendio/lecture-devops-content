Assignments
===========


During this course, you are asked to do a couple of assignments in order to pass the course and receive a grade:

* [Research & Discussion]({{< ref "/assignments/research-and-discussion" >}})
* [Project]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}})
* if necessary, a [retry exam]({{< ref "/assignments/retry-exam" >}})

Your grade is based on the outcome of the [*Project*]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}}). To be permitted to hand
in that assignment, you first have to successfully participate in the
[*Research & Discussion*]({{< ref "/assignments/research-and-discussion" >}}).

*NOTE: as soon as you have passed the *[Research & Discussion]({{< ref "/assignments/research-and-discussion" >}})*
assignment, you are obliged to receive a grade for this course, or in other words: your attempt to take the exam began
and the result will count.*

Should you not pass the [*Project*]({{< ref "/assignments/project-work" >}}) assignment, you are free to take a
*[retry exam]({{< ref "/assignments/retry-exam" >}})* in order to still pass the course.
