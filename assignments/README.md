Assignments
===========


During this course, you are asked to do a couple of assignments in order to pass the course and receive a grade:

* [Research & Discussion](./research-and-discussion.md)
* [Project](./project.md)
* if necessary, a [retry exam](./retry-exam.md)

Your grade is based on the outcome of the [*Project*](./project.md). To be permitted to hand in
that assignment, you first have to successfully participate in the [*Research & Discussion*](./research-and-discussion.md).

*NOTE: as soon as you have passed the *[Research & Discussion](./research-and-discussion.md)* assignment, you
are obliged to receive a grade for this course, or in other words: your attempt to take the exam began and the result
will count.*

Should you not pass the [*Project*](./project.md) assignment, you are free to take a *[retry exam](./retry-exam.md)*
in order to still pass the course.
