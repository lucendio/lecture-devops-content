Tutorials
=========


These tutorials are intended to be small and __optional__ hands-on tasks that we
will do during class. Ideally, every lecture topic (weekly) comes with one or more
corresponding tasks.

Performing these tasks should help you to familiarize yourself with technologies you
might be going to use in your [exercise assignment](./../assignments/exercise.md).

The tasks are very basic in terms of what each technology is capable of. For more
extensive tutorials either refer to the [link collection](./../links.md) or to 
a web search you find least untrustworthy.
